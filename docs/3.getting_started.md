# üõ†Ô∏è Run S-Graphs On Your Data

1. Define the transformation between your sensors (LIDAR, IMU, GPS) and base_link of your system using static_transform_publisher (see [line](https://github.com/snt-arg/s_graphs/blob/c0489660552cb3a2fc8ac0bef17998ee5fb6e15a/launch/s_graphs_launch.py#L118), s_graphs_launch.py). All the sensor data will be transformed into the common `base_link` frame, and then fed to the SLAM algorithm. Note: `base_link` frame in virtual dataset is set to `base_footprint` and in real dataset is set to `body`. You can set the `frames`, `topics` for your dataset easily during the launch execution as follows:

```bash
ros2 launch lidar_situational_graphs s_graphs_launch.py compute_odom:=true lidar_topic:=/rs_lidar/points
```

3. If you have an odometry source convert it to base ENU frame, then set the arg `compute_odom` to `false` in `s_graphs_ros2_launch.py` and then remap odom topic in **s_graphs_node** like

```bash
ros2 launch lidar_situational_graphs s_graphs_launch.py compute_odom:=false lidar_topic:=/rs_lidar/points odom_topic:=/odom
```

!!! info

    If you want to visualize the tfs correctly from your odom source, you MUST provide a tf from the `odom` to `base_link` frame.
