# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

!!! info

    S-Graphs has only been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, ROS2 Foxy, Humble Distros.

## üì¶ From Source

!!! warning "Important"

    Before proceeding, make sure you have `rosdep` installed. You can install it using `sudo apt-get install python3-rosdep`
    In addition, ssh keys are needed to be configured on you GitHub account. If you haven't
    yet configured ssh keys, follow this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

1. Update Rosdep:

```bash
rosdep init
rosdep update --include-eol-distros
```

2. Create a ROS2 workspace for S-Graphs

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/workspaces && cd $HOME/workspaces
```

3. Clone the S-Graphs repository into the created workspace

```bash
git clone git@github.com:snt-arg/lidar_situational_graphs.git -b feature/multi_floor s_graphs
```

!!! info

    If you have Nvidia GPU please install CUDA from this [link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive). This code has only been tested with CUDA 11.8.
    If you dont have CUDA S-Graphs will use CPU only.

4. Install required dependencies.

!!! info

    Lidar SGraphs can can take some time to build depending on the platform and may consume a lot of memory.
    If your computer does not have a lot of RAM is it advised to limit the number of threads make uses with
    `export MAKEFLAGS="-j <n>`, where `<n>` should be replaced with the max of number of CPUs.

```bash
cd s_graphs && source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

!!! info

    If you want to compile with debug traces (from backward_cpp) run:
    ```bash
    colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DUSE_RGB_CLOUD=ON
    ```

#### Optional ROS1 Install (Old Version of Room Segmentation) <a id="installation-for-ros1"></a>

<details>

> [!NOTE]
> This is an optional older version of room segmentation algorithm which requires ROS1 noetic. There is no hard dependecy on this package so you can easily ignore this step.

##### Download ROS Bridge <a id="download-ros-bridge"></a>

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash && sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros1-bridge
```

##### Installation on ROS1

!!! warning

    Before following the instructions from below, ensure that you are in a fresh
    terminal, **without ROS2 sourced**.

1. Create a ROS1 workspace for S-Graphs

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/workspaces/s_graphs_ros1_ws/src && cd $HOME/workspaces/s_graphs_ros1_ws/src && source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

2. Clone the S-Graphs repository into the created workspace

```bash
git clone git@github.com:snt-arg/lidar_situational_graphs.git -b feature/multi_floor s_graphs
```

3. Install required dependencies using `vcstool`

```bash
cd s_graphs && vcs import --recursive ../ < .rosinstall_ros1
```

4. Install required ROS packages

```bash
cd ../../ && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y -r
```

5. Install `pcl_ros`

```sh
sudo apt install ros-noetic-pcl-ros
```

6. Build workspace

!!! warning

    Make sure s_graphs_ros1_ws is built in Release otherwise the room extraction won't work properly.

```bash
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && catkin build
```

## üß™ Unit Tests <a id="unit-tests"></a>

Some unit tests are available. In case you want to add additional tests, run the following command:

```bash
colcon test --packages-select s_graphs --event-handler=console_direct+
```
